                If alpha/beta cell is empty, no conversion will take place for that structure. Values entered must be decimal numbers, for example, 2, 3, 4.6 etc. Do not put in 0 when

                <Italic>Descending</Italic> order means that the voxels within the overlapping region
                will have the highest alpha/beta value out of all the structures that contribute to this region. 
                <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                <Italic>Ascending</Italic> order means that the voxels within the overlapping region

                <Bold>Force edge conversion</Bold><LineBreak/>
                Because the script only converts those dose voxels that have centers inside the structure, the structure
                edges may not be sampled adequately. To improve the conversion, one can add a margin to the structure in 
                order to ensure that the whole structure is covered with converted voxels. The margin is normally the size
                of the dose voxel. When using this function, the script will create an auxiliary structure set where
                inflated structures will be created for calculation. After conversion, the structures will be deleted, but
                the structure set (and the image) will remain.

                <LineBreak/>
                The script will write back to the local database. A new verification plan will be created with a modified dose distribution. The plan will not have any fields.
                This plan cannot and should not be used for patient treatment!

                <Bold>Result of the conversion</Bold><LineBreak/>
                When conversion has finished a message window will appear.
                <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>

                <LineBreak/><LineBreak/>
                The message windows shows three scaling factors. In almost all circumstances the first two factors should be
                equal, and the last one should be exactly 1. The first factor is the ratio between voxel absolute dose in Gy and
                raw 32 bit voxel value. The second factor is the same ratio, except it is calculated on the created plan before
                voxels are overridden with new values. The last factor is an additional correction factor with which the 
                modified raw voxel values are multiplied. It is only needed when the conversion is performed on a plan from a 3rd party
                planning system with unknown fractionation, or if fractionation was changed in Eclipse.

                <Bold>Preview</Bold><LineBreak/>
                A new window will appear. The script will make an in-memory conversion without writing back to the database. The left plot will show the original dose distribution,
                the right plot will show the converted dose distribution. The right plot is connected to the left plot, but not vice-versa. The following commands are possible:
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Underline>Left mouse button</Underline> - tracker will appear. Values of dose will be in Gy.<LineBreak/>
                <Underline>Right mouse button </Underline> - zoom region. Works on both plots, but if used on the right plot, it will zoom on both.<LineBreak/>
                <Underline>Right mouse double click</Underline> - zoom reset.<LineBreak/>
                <Underline>Middle mouse button scroll</Underline> - slice scroll. The scrolling is performed among dose planes, not image planes.<LineBreak/>
                <Underline>Middle mouse click</Underline> - pan.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Italic>Dose slice</Italic> is the index of the current dose plane. Full dose matrix can be reviewed. <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Italic>Image (contour) slice</Italic> is the index of the image plane, from which the contours are taken for display.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                Because the dose matrix and the image matrix can have different resolutions, the image slice often does not match
                the dose slice. 
                For a very fine dose grid one may notice that the image slice does not vary when dose slice is changed.
                This is normal. The script does not perform interpolation of contours between image slices. 
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                
                <Bold>DVH</Bold><LineBreak/>
                DVH is calculated without interpolation. Only those dose voxels are taken into account, that have centers inside
                the structure. For that reason, the DVH has poor accuracy for smaller structures. To improve the accuracy,
                recalculate the plan with smaller dose voxels.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                Two DVH curves are displayed. One (solid) belongs to the original dose distribution, and is calculated with Eclipse.
                The other (dashed) belongs to the modified dose distribution, and is calculated independently.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                The table has the following columns to evaluate structure coverage with dose voxels:
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Italic>Dose cover Eclipse</Italic> - structure coverage with dose calculated with Eclipse.<LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Italic>Sampling cover Converted</Italic> - the ratio N V_0 / V_structure, where N is the number of dose voxels
                with centers inside the structure, V_0 is the volume of one dose voxel, and V_structure is the volume of the structure.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Bold>Important notes</Bold><LineBreak/>
                1. The conversion only works for HFS, HFP, FFS, FFP orientations. If the treatment orientation is
                forced in the plan, the conversion will be correct, however, the verification plan will show the original
                orientation.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                2. Before you create a verification plan it is prudent to check if the voxels were properly detected. Select "Multiply by a/b" and run Preview. On the plot
                check that the voxels are nicely detected. If they are not, you may have a problem.
                <LineBreak/>
                <LineBreak/>
                3. If you are not satisfied with the detection of dose voxels inside the structure (see point 2), reduce the size of the voxel or slightly change the calculation volume limits. Or increase the margin.
